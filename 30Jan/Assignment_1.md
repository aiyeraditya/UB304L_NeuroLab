# Assignment 1:
## Introduction
We dissected a cockroach leg and looked at baseline and stimulated action potentials to infer rate coding and adaptation.
% This is exactly what we did

## Questions
* What happens if you choose threshold too low or too high?

* What happens to the firing rate as stimulus strength reduces?

  * Why is it called rate coding?

  * Why do sensory systems need rate coding?

* Is the mean amplitude same across baseline and stimulus? Why?

* How does firing rate change with time?

* What do you understand about the sensory system from adaptation?
